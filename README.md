# FileCompression
> Text File Compression Program that uses Huffman code to Compress files into smaller size of bytes.

## Input
* 20 .txt files that need to be compressed, using Huffman code Algorithm, into new files of smaller size

## Output 
* Frequency of each character in the text file.
* Huffman code for each character in the text file.
* Encoded string in 0's & 1's resulted from the encode function performing the compression Algorithm.
* Sizes of both the Original file and the Compressed file in bytes.
* Ratio of compression.
